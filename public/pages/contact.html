	<h3 class="question noselect" align="left">What exactly is BITE Club?</h3>
	<h3 class="answer noselect" align="left">BITE Club is a nutritional science club that seeks to raise awareness of the nutritional value of the foods we consume daily. We do this through experiments in which foods are separated, fun demos in which we make yummy food, and themed food meetings in which we talk about the theme (i.e. vegan diets, non-GMOs) while eating delicious food.</h3>
