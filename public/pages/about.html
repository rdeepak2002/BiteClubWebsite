	<h3 class="abtParagraph noselect" align="left">Join us on Wednesdays during lunch to fill your brains with knowledge and fill your stomachs with good food. Learn how to enjoy food while staying healthy.</h3>

	<h3 class="abtParagraph noselect" align="left">Our goal is to focus on the ingredients within the foods that students consume; the origins of the things we eat. In addition, we will learn how certain food selections impact our personal health as well as the health of the global community. Ultimately, our hope is to introduce you to more healthy, sustainable, tasty foods that could be easily implemented into your daily lives.</h3>
